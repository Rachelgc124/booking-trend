2. other covariates,
3. the interaction between products,

consider models such as ARIMA, LSTM, Linear Regression, Random Forest, ARIMAX, and VAR to make predictions by the methods of direct forecasting and forecasting by product category. 

The root mean square error criterion and mean absolute error criterion are used to select the optimal model.
